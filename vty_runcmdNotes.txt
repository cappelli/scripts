Last router above had RADIUS stats incrementing. This was at 150 as of 6/30/14. CHeck again in july.

# Proper US Radius from working router looks like below in R069. See doc RADIUS-PhonExTemplate doc on this computer for template
# NOTE: For stores inside AMR use the 17.150.5.253 PhoneX server. All others use the 17.0.56.122 server!

In an effort to make sure I can catch similar configuration errors in the future I pulled up the ‘diffs’ from HPNA to compare yesterday’s config to the newly repaired config that you have implemented. A few QQs (non urgent; only if you have time):
Line 43 below shows "aaa accounting connection h323” which differs from the CME as-built. Is that a one-off difference or is that something I can add to the as-built PDF?
observation: Line 27 changes the ‘aaa group’ name to Retail-CDR blowing away the previous iManage name for that group.
observation: You remove the 17.209 server and replace it with the new RADIUS host: server-private 17.150.5.253 auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813 non-standard
observation: VRF and RADIUS lines are added, consistent with the as-built guide
Lines 44 - 50 removed. That’s one I would have missed. Were those lines you removed or were they automatically replaced because that syntax is deprecated in favor of new style: 'aaa accounting connection h323 start-stop group Retail-CDR’?
